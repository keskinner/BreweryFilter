<strong>Brewery Finder</strong>

This app filters through all breweries in a city and narrows down a search by brewery type. Search results are then plotted on a map with markers. The user can change the breweries that are shown on the map by the following types: brewery/pubs, miro breweries, large breweries, or regional breweries. 

<strong>Motivation</strong>

I wanted a simple and easy way for users to find the type of brewery that they're looking for.
